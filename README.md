# Millie_Project

In the pursuit of optimizing the operational efficiency of Millie’s Ice Cream and Coffee Shop at Tepper School of Business, we created the current Digital Twin model that helps with making important decisions. This novel model mirrors Millie’s week-long sales data, serving as a dynamic representation of the actual business.

Excel Tables:
Data_Millie: Millie's weekly sales on a hourly basis.
Millie_rawitem: Cost of Price of individual menu items.
Process_time: time required to prepare each menu items.

The python file includes all the codes of the model. Upon running the current model, the initial output includes four comprehensive summary tables, offering an overview of Millie’s operational landscape. These tables, constituting the model's baseline, set the stage for further exploration and enhancement. To foster a nuanced understanding of Millie under various scenarios, we devised three plausible modifications of input values. Users navigating this tool will see the transformation of these modifications into modified baseline tables, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
The primary objective of this undertaking is to empower Millie’s in organizing inventory purchases, orchestrating employee arrangement, and gaining a profound understanding of the popularity dynamics of individual items. In essence, we aspire to catalyze a paradigm shift in Millie’s operational prowess.
By harnessing the capabilities of the current model, Millie’s manager is equipped to minimize wastage in labor expenses. This not only aligns with the ethos of resource optimization but also underscores our commitment to fostering an environment where every operational facet contributes seamlessly to the overarching success of Millie’s Ice Cream and Coffee Shop.
